Leet Code 75 Problems


Key Points:

# Graph
Tips for Choosing the Right Algorithm:
Shortest Path in Unweighted Graphs: Use BFS.

Shortest Path in Weighted Graphs (Non-Negative Weights): Use Dijkstra's Algorithm.

Shortest Path in Weighted Graphs (With Negative Weights): Use Bellman-Ford Algorithm.

All-Pairs Shortest Path: Use Floyd-Warshall Algorithm.

Minimum Spanning Tree: Use Prim's or Kruskal's Algorithm.

Pathfinding with Heuristics: Use A* Search.
